# shashank-portfolio

Personal portfolio built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.

Live demo: https://shashank-portfolio.vercel.app

Quick start

```cmd
cd C:\Users\shash\OneDrive\Attachments\Desktop\portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build

```cmd
npm run build
npm start
```

Deployment

- Recommended: Deploy to Vercel by importing the GitHub repo `padhayay88/shashank-portfolio`.
- The project is a Next.js app; Vercel auto-detects the framework.

Notes

- `node_modules/` and `.next/` are git-ignored. Do not commit build outputs.
- If you see prerender/SSR errors with Framer Motion, components using animations are loaded client-side.
